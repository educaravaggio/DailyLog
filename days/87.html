  <h1 class="logTitle">Day 87 (09/Nov/18)</h1>
  <p class="logBody logBodyDays">Today I followed the FreeCodeCamp.org lessons for ES6 especification to learn about Arrow Functions, Methods, Rest and Spread, and Destructuring.<br>
      Starting with Arrow Functions to write shorter anonymous Functions. It's hard to grasp its concepts as it is not as clear.<br>
      <img src="imgs/87_arrow-functions.PNG">
      The next lessons were about <span>Higher Order Arrow Functions</span>, that use arrow methods, <span>like map(), filter(), reduce(),</span> etc. I had to watch some Youtube videos to understand it better and read documentation at Mozilla web docs.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4awPsyugS0">The first video by the channel The Coding Train</a> was more generic. I next watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnYlhbpzhU4"> video about the map() and fill()</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmnH5MT_luk"> another one only about filter()</a> on the same channel.<br>
      <span>map()</span> creates an array based on the result of calling a function for every element of other array.<br>
      <span>filter()</span> creates another array based on the parameters to filter the items.<br>
      <img src="imgs/87_map.PNG">
      The following lessons were of <span>Rest</span> and <span>Spread</span> parameters. Both can be used to copy items from a variable array in length. Which means, you don't need to hard code the amount of items.

      They can be used to <span>Destructuring</span> functions.

      I watched two excellent Youtube videos about them on the freeCodeCamp channel. The lessons were given by Beau. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLx4ma8ZqvQ"> Video on Rest and Spread operators</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vR3a11Wzt0">one about Destructuring.</a></p>
