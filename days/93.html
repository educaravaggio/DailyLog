    Followed the lessons on Section 2 of the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning"> "Modern Javascript from the Beginning" at Udemy</a>, by Brad Traversy. I reviewed some lessons on functions, array methods and loops. There's always something new to learn.<br>

    I rebuilt the Mario's pyramid in Javascript. The original one, taken from the CS50 course on edX, on C used nested loops. There was one loop for each line and other loop for the height. JS might take a different approach, as the guys from the Chingu cohort community at Slack has taught. It uses padStart() and padEnd() to add a desired character at the beginning or at the end of the string. There is this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHX6fis7Wc"> great video on Youtube</a> as well.
