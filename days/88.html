    I learned and practiced about Template Literals at <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp.org</a>, which are a way to concatenate strings and data using JavaScript.<br>
    I watched a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INPob8yPyBo"> Brad Traversy</a> and other by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCcxKp_HbKk"> techsith channel</a>, both produce amazing and easy to understand content, I learn a lot from them.<br>
    Instead of using '+' to concatenate strings and quotes it uses backticks(``) and ${} as a placeholder for variable and even  expressions such as ${a + b}. It can also be used for multiple lines without the need of using \n to create a new line.<br>

    As a tagged template, it outputs two separate parameters, such as string and values:

    Used to access data in an object, it can print out lists from arrays, using arrays methods, like map() in this case, that output each item on its own line:

    I also started the class lessons but I found it quite hard to understand and I couldn't find a better way to learn it. I'll be back to class tomorrow.
