##What is it
It's my attempt to track my learning path.
I've been following the #100DaysOfCode at twitter for almost 3 months.  
There are days when I can't tell what I have learnt.  
I try to tweet about my progress daily but it is hard to really understand from where I start to where I am now.  
Inspired by [Arron Kennedy] (https://twitter.com/azathecoder) and [Audrey Delgado] (https://twitter.com/Audrey_Lin_D), I've decided to log more in depth my daily tech routine.
 
###DailyLog
I have created a central github page with links to my [daily activities:] (http://www.link).
